# Capstone-Project___
Overview
This project is part of a capstone series designed to demonstrate practical application of data science skills including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and interpretation. The primary objective of this project is to solve a supervised machine learning problem using classification techniques.

Objective
The main goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will make a purchase or not using various classification algorithms. The dataset consists of 12330 rows and 18 columns. The focus is on optimizing model performance while ensuring the solution is interpretable and robust.
